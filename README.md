# Multilingual Text to Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion
---
## Description
- This project demonstrates a multilingual text-to-image generation system that uses AI to translate text prompts from various languages into English and generate corresponding images. 
  By leveraging Stable Diffusion, a cutting-edge diffusion model, this project enables seamless integration of language translation with creative visual outputs, opening possibilities 
  for global applications.
---
## Overview
- Developed a pipeline for generating high-quality images from text prompts written in multiple languages.
- Utilized AI-based translation tools to overcome language barriers and make the system globally accessible.
- Integrated Stable Diffusion with advanced schedulers to optimize image generation for efficiency and quality.
- Explored real-world scenarios like generating images for various themes and concepts based on multilingual inputs.
